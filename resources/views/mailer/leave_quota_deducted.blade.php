<p>Dear, {{ $name }}</p>

<p>This announcement serves to inform you about an upcoming adjustment to your leave quotas due to the recent joint holidays. As you know, these holidays were designated as non-working days for all government offices and private companies, including ours.</p>
<p>To ensure fairness and maintain a balanced leave distribution throughout the year, the Human Resources department has decided to deduct the corresponding number of leave days from all employees' annual leave quotas. This deduction will be reflected in your individual leave balances starting on 1 January.</p>
Here's a breakdown of the deduction:
<br><br>
Number of Joint Holidays: {{ $totalHolidays }}<br>
Leave Quota Deduction: {{ $totalHolidays }} days (equivalent to the number of joint holidays)<br>
We understand that this may affect your personal leave planning. To minimize any inconvenience, please note the following:
<br>
<br>
<p>This deduction only applies to your annual leave quota. Other leave types, such as sick leave or compassionate leave, remain unaffected.</p>
You can still apply for leave using the usual channels, but please be mindful of your revised leave balance.</p>
If you have any questions or concerns regarding this adjustment, please do not hesitate to contact the Human Resources department at hrd@perdana.co.id or admin@perdana.co.id.</p>
We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in this matter. Please continue to plan your leave responsibly and ensure smooth operations within your teams.</p>
